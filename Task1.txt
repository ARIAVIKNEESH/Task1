->Objects play a vital role in building complex for data structures in javascript.
->An object is a composite data type that allows developers to group related data and functions together.
->Objects can represent real-world entities and their behaviors, making them a powerful tool for organizing and managing code.

Internal Representation of Objects:
->Dictionary:
-------------
Object properties are stored in a dictionary, which allows for dynamic property addition and removal. This flexibility is a key feature of JavaScript objects.

->Hidden Class:
---------------
To optimize property access and method invocation, JavaScript engines use a hidden class to track the shape of objects. When an object's structure changes, the hidden class is updated to ensure efficient property access.
